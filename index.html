                            August-September<br> After waiting for 6 months, I finally got the courage to ask for your number, i still remember it was drizzling that day after the gym, EB won and i out of the blue had the most weird motivation and then came the most intense question of the hour, "WOULD IT BE VERY WEIRD IF I ASKED FOR YOUR NUMBER?". And thank God the answer was not a slap...

                            September-October<br> Finally things were looking like I won't die single and I'm lovable as well, all thanks to this sweet chimpanzee. As a matter of fact the first time at Aparna's place made me realise that you were finally breaking your walls and letting me in......

                            October-November<br> Breaking the walls can always be a bit tricky ig, this month was the trickiest and most awkward phase of our this 1 year, we acted weirdly, cold and stubborn and even maybe we gave up all hopes on each-other. But we definitely spent our first puja together.

                            November-December<br> But ig we have to be optimistic and work on eachother even if there's only 1% hope and all thanks to the Almighty we did work on it, we finally understood that relations can go through hard times but all we need to do is to stay with eachother and work in it.

                            December-January<br> The lovey-dovey phase returned, we were laughing, giggling, making love, going out but oh yes we were and we still are stressed about our future, but one thing was for sure, we were not letting it affect us.....

                            January-February<br> This was undoubtably the best phase, we went to different places for dates, we hung out like always, going out for walks, trying new food and oh certainly you can't forget our first time going to the Book Fair which will always remain close to my heart.
